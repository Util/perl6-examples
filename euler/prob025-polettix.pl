# The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

# Fn = Fn1 + Fn2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
# Hence the first 12 terms will be:

#    F1 = 1
#    F2 = 1
#    F3 = 2
#    F4 = 3
#    F5 = 5
#    F6 = 8
#    F7 = 13
#    F8 = 21
#    F9 = 34
#    F10 = 55
#    F11 = 89
#    F12 = 144
#
